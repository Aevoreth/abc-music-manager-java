# PluginData / Songbook

ABC Music Manager can write **`SongbookData.plugindata`** files for the LOTRO Songbook plugin. There are many compatible versions of Songbook, and this tool should work with them all. It is meant to mimic tools such as Songfiller.hta (ships with most versions of Songbook) or Songbooker.

## What it is

The file is a **Lua table source** (UTF-8 text) stored under `<LOTRO>\PluginData\<AccountName>\AllServers\SongbookData.plugindata`. The Songbook plugin loads it when the plugin is loaded in-game. It is the library used by the plugin to sync and play music in game.

The app builds the file from your indexed library and configured paths.

1. Set your LOTRO directory ([Folder rules](settings/folder-rules.md))
2. Click **Scan Account Targets**
