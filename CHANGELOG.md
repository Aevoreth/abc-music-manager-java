# Changelog

All notable changes to ABC Music Manager are documented here. Most recent at the top.

## Version 0.3.1b

- Fixed an issue with relay workers not being able to be deployed from built executables due to the required scripts and worker not being bundled with the app.

## Version 0.3.0b

- First Java-based full-function port of the former Python version
- Uses same/similar UI elements as Maestro and ABC Player
- Utilizes the same playback engine and soundfont used by Maestro and ABC Player (used under MIT License). Result is a sound that is nearly identical to that of Maestro and ABC Player themselves.

## Version 0.2.9b

- Changed relay + code model for set playback/band assistant sharing to a single link model
- Set playback links provided by band leaders can either be pasted into the app (Band Assistant page) or be opened directly in the browser. NOTE: existing relays created before v0.2.9b will need to be redeployed.
- Fix in Windows .exe: Set selection in playback mode should no longer close the dropdown popup when opening a folder

## Version 0.2.8b

- Fixed a Foreign key error that was caused by re-exporting a file that was named incorrectly, causing file name, song name, and export timestamp to all change.

## Version 0.2.7b

- Setlist Editor
  - FIX: Clear Setlist will now also refresh the view, showing that the list was cleared.
  - FIX: Adding new setlist puts new set at the top of current folder instead of bottom.
- Band Editor
  - FIX: Changing a player assignment no longer requires delete and add new, removing the need to reassign parts to the updated player

## Version 0.2.6b

- ABC Playback
  - Fixed error preventing playback in compiled executable

## Version 0.2.5b

- ABC Playback:
  - Corrected ABC to Midi velocities
  - Added limiter/compresser support to reduce clipping during playback

## Version 0.2.4b

- Documentation:
  - ADD: Structured in-app User Guide (Help → User Guide); README trimmed to point at the guide.

## Version 0.2.3b

- Set Play:
  - FIX: Part Change Highlighting is now based on next selected song vs. currently playing song, not next selected song vs. previous song in the list.

## Version 0.2.2b

- Setlist and Set Play
  - FIX: Setlist Editor was not fully deleting sets if that set had a Set Play playback history, leaving behind an empty set instead
  - FIX: Newly created setlists were not showing up in Set Play until app restart (Due to list only refreshing on startup)
  - FIX: Set Play no longer requires a band layout for sets to be loaded.
  - ADD: Ability to clear a setlist
  - IMPROVE: Set Play Set selection combo box now has a tree view for folders and sets
  - IMPROVE: Replaced "Add Song" dialogue with a proper, filterable song table similar to Library view

## Version 0.2.1b

- Added: Set Play feature
  - Select and load setlist
  - Broadcast set playback status via a user-created Cloudflare Relay (Cloudflare account required; even heavy usage under normal circumstances will never come close to exceeding free-tier usage)
  - Cloudflare Relay URL defined in Settings; multiple relays can be defined and used for different bands
  - Song list with checkboxes for skip, next, Current, and Played
  - Advancing a song marks the currently selected Current song as Played, the currently selected next song as Current, and the next song in the setlist that is not marked skip as next
  - Band layout with part change highlighting
  - List of band member names; selecting member(s) highlights them on the band layout (not broadcast; client only)
  - Option to automatically mark songs played in Library Playback History
- Added: Band Assistant
  - Select relay and enter the seven-character code from the band leader, then Connect
  - Read-only view of what the band leader is broadcasting, including the song list with skip, next, current, and played fields and the band layout with instrument change highlighting
  - List of band member names; selecting member(s) highlights them on the band layout (not broadcast; client only)
- Added: Settings → Set Playback tab
  - Add band-leader-provided relay URLs for coordinated set playback
  - Generate a WebSocket relay URL to share with band members also using the app
  - Redeploy a Cloudflare Relay in the unlikely event that Cloudflare resource limits are reached
- Note: Creating a relay requires a free Cloudflare account and must be set up and logged in before launching the relay setup wizard. At the appropriate step, the wizard opens the system default browser to authenticate with Cloudflare. A relay can only be created after this authentication completes.
